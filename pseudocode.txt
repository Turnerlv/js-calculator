    Sub 01.04 Setup the input#2
        - Variable for the second number selected OR pressed on the keyboard
        - Starts at 'null'

Step 02 - Gather the first input
    Sub 02.01 When the user presses buttons/keystroke of integers, assign values in sequence to input#1
    Sub 02.02 Display value of input to display as they are entered

Step 03 - Gather the operator
    Sub 03.01 When the user selects buttons/keystrokes of accepted operators, assign value to operator Variable
    Sub 03.02 If another operator is selected, replace the current operator value

Step 04 - Gather the second number
    Sub 04.01 When the user presses buttons/keystroke of integers, assign values in sequence to input#1
    Sub 04.02 Display value of input to display as they are entered

Step 05 - Calculate the result
    Sub 05.01 When the user clicks any operator, display the result of input#1 & input#2 using the operator to display
    Sub 05.02 If the user selects another operator, repeat Step 03

Utility - backspace
    - user clicks "DEL"
    - check which input is being typed
    - remove last digit from input
